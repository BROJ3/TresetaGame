#game logic - first text

1st - one player is "the dealer", and the other player begins the game
2st - deal 10 cards, first to player who didnt shuffle, then todealer
3rd - one who didnt shuffle begins the game, throws one card
responder must respond with the same suit and a stronger card to add to his pile of points
after a hand is player, players draw a card and show it to each other and add it to their hands. They should have 10 in their hand
this goes on until the deck is empty and players keep playing until they have no more cards in the hand
whoever picks up last hand gets an extra point to their total score
